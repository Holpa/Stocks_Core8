# Stocks_Core8

This Program will be used to track stocks protfolio, potentially it will be an .exe or something easy to run

# Title: Stock Tracker

# Description:

Using CORE 8 eventually connect with HTMX as Frontend

# Problem solve

Handling your protfolio can causes overhead especially if you are an active trader
This software will help you manage your protfolio with neat front end interface

# WHY HTMX

Why should only <a> and <form> be able to make HTTP requests?

- Why should only click & submit events trigger them?
- Why should only GET & POST be available?
- Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?

By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a hypertext"

Personal Opinion HTMX removes the complexity of the front end, to be specific Single Page Applications!
Also makes it possible for any backend to connect with the frontend

# Quick Start

Simply clone the project then run it against .NET core 8

# Usage

Run the application 'dotnet run'
